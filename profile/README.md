# Welcome

This GitHub organization is used by the Web Application Development course at
Carnegie Mellon University.

We have no public repositories (other the .github repo with this profile information).

If you are a student taking the course, you will be given access to
private repositories in which you will develop your
homework and course projects. You will also get access to
repositories with sample code discussed in class.

To get access to repos in this organization, enrolled students must submit
their GitHub username via this webpage:
[https://www.cmu-webapps.org/github-status](https://www.cmu-webapps.org/github-status).
(This link should be active on the first day of classes.)

After you have access, you will be able to scroll down this page
to see all the repos to which you have access.

For more information about the course, please see the current
syllabus which is available on the course website:
