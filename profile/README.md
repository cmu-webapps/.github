# Welcome

This GitHub Organization is used by the Web Application Development course at Carnegie Mellon University.

We have no public respositories (other the .github repo with profile info).

If you're a student taking the course, you will have access to
private repositories in which you will develop your
homework and course projects. You will also be given access to
repositories with sample code shown in class.
You can scroll down this page to see all these repos.

For more information about the course, please see the current
syllabus which is available on the course website:
