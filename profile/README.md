# Welcome

This GitHub Organization is used by the Web Application Development course at Carnegie Mellon University.

We have no public respositories (other the .github repo with profile info).

Students taking the course will have access to
private repositories in which they will develop their
homework and course projects. (They will also be given access to
repositories with sample code shown in class.)

For more information about the course, please see the current
syllabus which is available on the course website:
