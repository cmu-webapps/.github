# Welcome

This GitHub Organization is used by the Web Application Development course at Carnegie Mellon University.

We have no public respositories (other this .github repo with profile info).

Students taking the course will have access to
many private repositories containing classes examples as well as
repositories in which they will develop their
homework and course projects.

For more information about the course, please see the current
syllabus which is available on the course website:
